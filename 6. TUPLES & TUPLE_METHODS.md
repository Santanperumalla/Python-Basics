## **What is a Tuple in Python?**

A **tuple** is a **collection data type** in Python that can hold multiple items in a single variable.
It is **ordered**, **immutable** (cannot be changed after creation), and allows **duplicate values**.

### **Creating Tuples**

```python
# Empty tuple
t1 = ()

# Tuple with elements
t2 = (1, 2, 3)

# Tuple with mixed data types
t3 = (10, "hello", 3.14, True)

# Tuple without parentheses (packing)
t4 = 1, 2, 3, 4

# Nested tuple
t5 = (1, (2, 3), (4, 5))
```

**Note:** A single-element tuple must have a comma:

```python
single = (10,)   # valid tuple
not_tuple = (10) # just an integer
```

## **Accessing Tuple Elements**

```python
numbers = (10, 20, 30, 40)

print(numbers[0])    # 10 (first element)
print(numbers[-1])   # 40 (last element)
print(numbers[1:3])  # (20, 30) (slicing)
```

## **Tuple Methods**

Since tuples are **immutable**, they have only **two built-in methods**:

1. **count(value)** → Returns the number of times a value appears.

```python
t = (1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 2)
print(t.count(2))  # 3
```

2. **index(value, start, end)** → Returns the index of the first occurrence of a value.

```python
t = (10, 20, 30, 20)
print(t.index(20))        # 1
print(t.index(20, 2))     # 3 (search from index 2)
```

## **Other Tuple Operations**

Even though tuples don’t have many methods, you can still use **built-in functions**:

* `len(t)` → Get number of elements
* `max(t)` → Maximum element (if elements are comparable)
* `min(t)` → Minimum element
* `sum(t)` → Sum of elements (numeric tuples only)
* `sorted(t)` → Returns a sorted **list**
* `tuple(iterable)` → Convert iterable (like list, string) into a tuple

Example:

```python
t = (5, 2, 8, 1)

print(len(t))      # 4
print(max(t))      # 8
print(min(t))      # 1
print(sum(t))      # 16
print(sorted(t))   # [1, 2, 5, 8]
```

## **Tuple Packing and Unpacking**

```python
# Packing
student = ("Santan", 21, "Python")

# Unpacking
name, age, course = student
print(name)   # Santan
print(age)    # 21
print(course) # Python
```

**Key Points:**

* Tuples are **faster** than lists because they are immutable.
* Use tuples when you want to ensure data cannot be changed.
* Good for **fixed collections** (like coordinates, database records).
